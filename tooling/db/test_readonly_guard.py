"""
Unit tests for the read-only SQL guard. Run:  python3 -m pytest -q
(or just:  python3 test_readonly_guard.py)

Proves the worst-case guarantee the tool relies on: NOTHING but a single
SELECT-family statement can ever reach a database — across write/DDL/DCL/
transaction/session/admin verbs, multi-statement chaining, and comment/string
smuggling — while every real composed/detail query still passes.
